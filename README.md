# Stock picker ruby project for TOP

In this project, I created a simple Ruby program to identify the best days to buy and sell stocks for maximum profit. By analyzing an array of stock prices, the program pinpoints the most profitable pair of days with an efficient algorithm. I implemented this project as part of The Odin Project curriculum, honing my Ruby skills and deepening my understanding of algorithmic problem-solving. The project involved iterating through stock prices and ensuring the selected buy date preceded the sell date, while maximizing the profit margin.
